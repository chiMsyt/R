# R Variables

# Creating Variables in R
# Variables are containers for storing data values
# R does not have a command for declaring a variable
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it
# To assign a value to a variable, use "<-"

# Example
name <- "Tim"
age <- 22

name
age
