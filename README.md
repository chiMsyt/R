# R Progress Tracker ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my **R Programming Progress Tracker**!  
This repository is dedicated to learning, practicing, and mastering **R** for data science, statistics, and analytics.  
Each folder/project will include code, explanations, and notes that reflect my journey step by step.

## Roadmap

This roadmap serves as a guide for my growth in R programming:

1. **Basics of R**
   - Syntax, variables, operators
   - Data types (vectors, lists, matrices, factors, data frames)
   - Basic input/output
2. **Control Structures**
   - `if`, `else`, loops, functions
   - Apply family functions (`apply`, `lapply`, `sapply`)
3. **Data Manipulation**
   - Using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
   - Cleaning and reshaping datasets
4. **Data Visualization**
   - Base R plotting
   - `ggplot2` for advanced visualizations
5. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
   - Frequency tables and summaries
6. **Probability & Distributions**
   - Binomial, Normal, Poisson
   - Simulations and random sampling
7. **Inferential Statistics**
   - Hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA)
   - Confidence intervals
8. **Regression & Modeling**
   - Linear regression
   - Logistic regression
   - Model evaluation
9. **Advanced Topics**
   - Time series analysis
   - Clustering and classification
   - Machine learning basics in R
10. **Projects & Applications**
    - Real datasets
    - End-to-end data analysis projects

## Repository Structure

Each folder will be structured as:

R/
â”œâ”€â”€ basics/ # Introductory R programs
â”œâ”€â”€ data-manipulation/ # Using dplyr, tidyr
â”œâ”€â”€ visualization/ # ggplot2 and base plotting
â”œâ”€â”€ statistics/ # Descriptive & inferential stats
â”œâ”€â”€ probability/ # Distribution and simulations
â”œâ”€â”€ regression/ # Regression models
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/ # Capstone projects
â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file


Each subfolder will contain:
- `project-XX-name/` â†’ Code and scripts
- `README.md` â†’ Explanation, key takeaways, and reflections
